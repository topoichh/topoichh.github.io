1. We don't collect data from you.
We don't collect optional data, your IP Address and more because our site is secured.
Even if you made something your IP Address is being strongly secured.

2. No DDOS Attacks.
If you will do DDOS Attacks on topoichh.xyz, cgcristi.xyz and github.io domains you are cooked.
It is illegal to do so... just don't do it and you'll be fine. ( i hope)
